# MicroService Architecture Recovery (MiSAR) 
MiSAR is an approach that follows the Model Driven Architecture to semi-automatically generate architectural models of implemented microservice systems.
MiSAR consists of a parser that creates a Platform Specific Model from existing systems and a Model Tranformation engine that transforms platform Specifc Models into Platform Independent Model instances. An instance of a MiSAR Platform Independent Model is the recovered architectural model of the microservice system. 
To make usage of MiSAR, please go to the
