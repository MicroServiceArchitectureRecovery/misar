# MicroService Architecture Recovery (MiSAR) 
MiSAR is an approach that follows the Model Driven Architecture to semi-automatically generate architectural models of implemented microservice systems. A video demonstration of MiSAR can be found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdRDkLesyS0 

MiSAR consists of a parser that creates a Platform Specific Model from existing systems and a Model Tranformation engine that transforms platform Specifc Models into Platform Independent Model instances. An instance of a MiSAR Platform Independent Model is the recovered architectural model of the implemented microservice system. 

To make usage of MiSAR and generate MiSAR Platform Independent Models (architectural models) from existing microservice systems, please go to the https://github.com/MicroServiceArchitectureRecovery/MiSAR-Parser-and-Model-Transformation

To have UML-like representations of MiSAR's Platform Independent Models created, please go to https://github.com/MicroServiceArchitectureRecovery/misar-plantUML
